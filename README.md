## Project inspect
in this project we are supposed to work with the indexing structre and the insertion of the values of the index into a hashing structre 
using differnt methods: open addressing, chanining, extendable hashing and multiplehahsing

## Prerequest to run 
- just having gcc,g++ or clang to run the proejct 
- having make installed in your machine 

## Clone the proejct
- you can clone the project locally to run it 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Amr-Shams/CMPN407-Labs.git
```
in the directory named code you will find 2 Labs 

## Run the prog
- Lab01 
inside this lab we will have a `MakeFile` with two runs 
--- 
### Run Open Addressing
```bash
make run2
```
### Run MultiHashing 
```bash
make run2 1
```
### Run Chanining function
```bash
make run1
```
### Notes
- pls use `make clean` after any run

-----------------
### Lab02(Extendable Hahsing)
------
- running the file is much easier 
```bash 
make runn
```
