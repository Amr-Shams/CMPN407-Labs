# Project Inspection

In this project, our objective is to work with indexing structures and insert values into a hashing structure using various methods: open addressing, chaining, extendable hashing, and multiple hashing.

## Prerequisites to Run
- Ensure you have GCC, G++, or Clang installed on your machine.
- Make sure you have the `make` utility installed.

## Clone the Project
You can clone the project locally to run it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amr-Shams/CMPN407-Labs.git
cd code/
```
In the directory named `code`, you will find two labs.

## Run the Program

### Lab01
Inside this lab, we have a `MakeFile` with two runs:

#### Run Open Addressing
```bash
make run2
```

#### Run MultiHashing
```bash
make run2 1
```

#### Run Chaining Function
```bash
make run1
```

#### Notes
- Please use `make clean` after any run.

### Lab02 (Extendable Hashing)
Running the file is much easier:
```bash
make run
```
